This folder contains IGOR models for all directTCR lib1 and lib 2 donors, 
in addition to default IGOR models.
All models are based on unproductive sequences, and have been generated 
based on IMGT ref dir files downloaded Sep-2019
(except the IGOR default models; see the readme files stored in their directories).
All available unproductive sequences have been used, except for the following 
(due to igor/immunoprobs technical problems:
1421TRA (27003 seqs used)
1441TRA (25000 seqs used)
1451TRA (23295 seqs used)
